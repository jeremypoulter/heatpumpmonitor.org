<p>HeatpumpMonitor.org is an <a href="https://openenergymonitor.org">OpenEnergyMonitor</a> open source community initiative to share and compare real-world heat pump performance data.</p>
<p>As of <?php echo $date; ?> there are <?php echo $number_of_systems; ?> heat pump systems uploading data to the site, including systems installed by some of the best heat pump engineers in the UK.</p>

<p>The site is a useful peer-to-peer learning resource used by both customers and installers wishing to understand how to design, install and optimise heat pumps for high performance and low running costs.</p>

<H5>Accuracy & Boundaries</H5>
<p>Systems marked with 'MID' use billing grade MID approved Class 1 electricity metering and Class 2 heat metering equipment. These are the same meters used by RHI and other heat pump monitoring trials.</p>

<p>The Hx boundary i.e what's included in the monitoring is stated next to each system. The Hx boundaries are defined as follows*:</p>
<ul>
  <li>H1: Only includes the energy input to the heat pump compressor</li>
  <li>H2: Includes the energy input to the heat pump compressor and source fan(s) or brine pump(s)</li>
  <li>H3: Includes all energy inputs from H2 plus additional auxiliary energy such as backup or immersion heaters</li>
  <li>H4: Covers all energy inputs from H3, but also includes building circulation pump(s) or fans</li>
</ul>

<p><i>*These ‘boundaries’ have been defined by ‘SEPEMO’ (Seasonal Performance factor and Monitoring) for heat pump systems projects as recorded by the European Heat Pump Association (EHPA).</i></p>

<p>Unless otherwise stated the COP and SPF/SCOP figures on the site include combined space heating and DHW, some systems equipped with a DHW status sensor report a separate DHW only COP.</p>

<p>The majority of systems are monitored using the <a href="https://shop.openenergymonitor.com/level-3-heat-pump-monitoring-bundle-emonhp/"> OpenEnergyMonitor Level 3 Monitoring Bundle</a>, which provides 10s datalogging granularity.</p>
